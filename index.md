# Hi, I'm Brendon 👋

I build intelligent products and hands-on prototypes that blend **AI, automation, and user experience** to solve real business problems.

I work across strategy, design, and execution — leading teams that define **next-generation recruiting and HR tech at Amazon**, while also building **AI-powered automation tools** for small businesses and creators through my side venture, **Trillium Tech**.

Most of my projects are **working, vibe-coded examples**: real code, real interfaces, and measurable outcomes — from AI review analytics dashboards and recruiter training sandboxes to content automation platforms for fitness and healthcare.
